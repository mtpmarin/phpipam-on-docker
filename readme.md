# Phpipam ready to use on Docker

Just improving my older projects.
Ready to use [phpipam](https://github.com/phpipam/phpipam) on Docker with database.

1. Rename [.env.sample](./.env.sample) to .env
2. Alter the values inside
3. Run on docker
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
4. Access [localhost:8001](http:\\localhost:8001) and proceed with the installation
